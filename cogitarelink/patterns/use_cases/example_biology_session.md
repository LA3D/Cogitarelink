# Session Capture for Claude Memory System

**Session ID**: session_2024_06_17_14  
**Domain**: biology  
**Goal**: Find drug targets related to COVID-19 spike protein

## Session Narrative

I was researching COVID-19 spike protein drug targets, following up on recent papers about mutations affecting drug binding. I needed to find existing targets and pathway information.

### What Worked

Started with service discovery using `rdf_get https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql --cache-as uniprot_service` which took 2.3 seconds but cached 8MB of valuable metadata about UniProt's 225B+ triples and up: vocabulary. Then used `rdf_cache uniprot_service --graph` to load the complete ontology, discovering up:Protein and up:Gene classes.

The breakthrough came when I switched from trying direct UniProt search to using Wikidata as a hub. `cl_search "SARS-CoV-2" --limit 3` succeeded in 145ms, finding Q82069695 (SARS-CoV-2) and Q87917581 (spike protein). Then `cl_describe Q87917581` gave me the P352 (UniProt ID): P0DTC2 cross-reference in 220ms.

Finally, `cl_describe P0DTC2 --endpoint uniprot` worked perfectly in 180ms, giving me rich protein annotation, sequence data, and pathway references. The P352 cross-reference workflow proved highly effective.

### What Failed

My biggest mistake was assuming UniProt would work like Wikidata's API for text search. `cl_search "spike protein" --endpoint uniprot --limit 5` completely failed with an 800ms timeout and 0 results. UniProt doesn't support generic text search - it needs specific SPARQL patterns with FILTER regex.

This cost me about 15 minutes of troubleshooting before I realized the fundamental difference between endpoints.

### Key Insights

The "hub and spoke" pattern is incredibly effective for biology research: use Wikidata as the discovery hub, then follow cross-references to specialized databases. Wikidata API is about 5x faster than SPARQL endpoints for initial discovery (145ms vs 800ms timeouts).

P352 (UniProt protein ID) is an extremely reliable bridge property - I should always look for this first in biology research. The discovery-first workflow with service description and vocabulary navigation prevented multiple failed queries that would have resulted from guessing up: prefixes incorrectly.

Cross-reference following is often more reliable and faster than trying to query domain databases directly. The time invested in service description (2.3s) pays off quickly by avoiding repeated discovery overhead.
