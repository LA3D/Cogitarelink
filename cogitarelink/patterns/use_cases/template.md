# Session Capture for Claude Memory System

**Session ID**: session_YYYY_MM_DD_HH  
**Domain**: [biology/chemistry/general]  
**Goal**: [one-line research objective]

## Session Narrative

[Write a natural narrative of what you tried to accomplish and what happened. Focus on:]

### What Worked
- Commands that succeeded and why
- Effective workflows or sequences  
- Performance insights or surprises
- Cross-reference patterns that worked

### What Failed
- Commands that failed and error details
- Wrong assumptions or approaches
- Time wasted on ineffective strategies
- Recovery strategies that worked

### Key Insights
- Patterns you noticed across tools
- Domain-specific behaviors discovered
- Performance differences between approaches
- Things you wish you'd known at the start

## Distillation Instructions for Claude

When analyzing this session narrative, extract CLAUDE.md-style memories following these patterns:

### Reminder Format
```markdown
- Always [specific action] when [context] (prevents [specific problem])
- Use [tool/approach] for [specific use case] (because [concrete benefit])
- [Domain] research: [specific pattern] → [expected outcome]
```

### Anti-Pattern Format  
```markdown
- NEVER [specific mistake] → leads to [specific consequence]
- Avoid [approach] in [context] → use [alternative] instead
- [Tool] doesn't support [feature] → use [workaround]
```

### Performance Guidance
```markdown
- [Tool A] is [X]x faster than [Tool B] for [specific use case]
- Cache [what] early to avoid [specific delay]
- [Endpoint] timeout patterns: [specific guidance]
```

### Domain-Specific Patterns
```markdown
- [Domain] workflows: [sequence] → [typical outcome]
- [Database] specializes in [data type] → best for [research goal]
- Cross-reference [property] → [database] → high success rate for [domain]
```

Focus on creating memories that:
1. **Prevent repeated mistakes** (most important)
2. **Speed up common workflows** 
3. **Guide tool selection** for specific contexts
4. **Capture domain expertise** for reuse

Write memories as if updating a team's shared CLAUDE.md file.
