# Overview

Cogitarelink (“to think connectedly”) is a Python library for working
with Linked Open Data as semantic memory for LLMs and agents. It enables
processing, validation, and navigation of JSON-LD 1.1 data with context
awareness, allowing intelligent systems to build and maintain verifiable
knowledge representations.

## Motivation

Current AI systems face significant challenges with knowledge
management:

- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Information is scattered across
  documents, databases, and unstructured sources
- **Context Loss**: Knowledge is stripped of its semantic context when
  converted to vector embeddings
- **Verification Difficulty**: Generated content can’t be easily traced
  to source facts
- **Reasoning Opacity**: Most reasoning happens in opaque model weights
  rather than explainable logical steps
- **Trust Boundaries**: Agents lack mechanisms to cryptographically
  verify information exchanged with other agents

Cogitarelink addresses these challenges by providing a structured,
semantic memory system that preserves context, enables verification, and
supports transparent reasoning.

## Core Philosophy

Cogitarelink follows these key design principles:

- **Micro-Kernel Architecture**: Core functionality in ~600 LOC, with
  business logic in data artifacts (contexts, ontologies, rules)
- **Knowledge as Graphs**: All information represented as semantic
  graphs with explicit relationships
- **Verifiable Provenance**: Every fact tracked with its origin,
  enabling source attribution and trust assessment
- **Agent-Centric Design**: Optimized for use by LLMs and agents rather
  than human developers
- **Domain-Agnostic**: Framework provides tools and patterns applicable
  across knowledge domains

## Development Approach

Cogitarelink uses an **agent-driven development** approach:

- Large parts of the codebase are written and maintained by AI coding
  agents (Claude Code and OpenAI Codex)
- Business logic lives in data artifacts (SPARQL queries, SHACL rules)
  generated by AI agents at runtime
- Domain-specific knowledge is encoded in ontologies and rules rather
  than Python code
- The core team focuses on architectural patterns and guiding the
  overall system design
- Continuous integration and testing ensure high quality of AI-generated
  contributions

This innovative development model enables rapid iteration while
maintaining quality and architectural coherence.

## Key Capabilities

- **Entity Management**: Immutable, normalized entities with
  deterministic signatures
- **Vocabulary Registry**: Centralized management of semantic
  vocabularies with collision detection
- **Context Processing**: Expansion, compaction and normalization of
  JSON-LD contexts
- **Graph Storage**: In-memory or RDFLib-backed storage with query
  capabilities
- **SPARQL Integration**: Execute queries against endpoints with
  ontology-based validation
- **Provenance Tracking**: Record source information for all derived
  facts
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Reason about time-based relationships and
  sequences
- **Verification**: Cryptographic signing and validation with SHACL
  support

  ## Knowledge Artifact Layers

Cogitarelink organizes semantic knowledge into a layered stack:

1.  **Context Layer** (\*.context.jsonld)
    - Term to IRI mappings
    - Localized vocabulary subsets
    - Compact JSON representation (\<5KB)
2.  **Ontology Layer** (ontology.ttl/.jsonld)
    - Class/property definitions
    - Domain/range constraints
    - Semantic relationships
3.  **Shapes/Rules Layer** (shapes.ttl, rules.ttl)
    - SHACL constraints on data shape
    - SPARQL rules for inference
    - Validation patterns
4.  **Data Layer** (\*.jsonld)
    - Actual entity instances
    - Event records
    - Knowledge statements
